This new workspace, which lives inside the 'Workspaces' folder of your home directory, is a place where you can store all relevant and related files to a particular project. For example, if you are working on multiple projects, its nice to have them separated as follows: -|home dir    -|Workspaces     -| Project 1     -| Project 2     -| Project 3",
